## Overview
The **17-Day Challenge** is a personal project to create one website every day for 17 consecutive days. Each project is a unique concept, showcasing creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving in web development. This journey began on **21.12.24** and ends on **06.01.25**, during my winter holidays. ❤️

### Challenge Goal:
Build 17 websites in 17 days to sharpen skills, explore new ideas, and have fun while creating.  
All projects are or will be **open-source**, so feel free to contribute, modify, or use them as you like!
